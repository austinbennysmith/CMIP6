### This folder contains the code used to make graphs of projections for the change over time in northern vs southern hemisphere extratropical temperature. 
The first file, [N_S_Temps.ipynb](https://github.com/austinbennysmith/CMIP6/blob/main/EEPS_1430/N_S_Temps/N_S_Temps.ipynb), makes a csv file with a time series representing change over time in this temperature difference for a given model. Once [N_S_Temps.ipynb](https://github.com/austinbennysmith/CMIP6/blob/main/EEPS_1430/N_S_Temps/N_S_Temps.ipynb) was run for the models I wanted to consider, I loaded all the resulting files into [Plotting_NSTemps.ipynb](https://github.com/austinbennysmith/CMIP6/blob/main/EEPS_1430/N_S_Temps/Plotting_NSTemps.ipynb) to plot the time series together and see the different projections given different models.
